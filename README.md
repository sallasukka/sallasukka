## Hi guys!

I am Salla and in this README, you can learn a bit about me and my interests, in addition to my projects I have been working on. Welcome!

At the moment I...
- am studying software development
- am interested in cyber safety; especially black hat hacking and their ways of infiltrating systems and the ways they scam regular internet users
- am interested in how to create simple software; especially the thought of simplicity and how to achieve that
- want to work on projects that would make life easier for those who feel like it's too much.
